# Foreman

Autonomous operating system for the operator. Give it a goal in any domain — code, research, marketing, strategy — and it decomposes, dispatches, tracks, learns, and drives to completion.

## Architecture

```
Operator ↔ Conversation (Pi/Slack/CLI) ↔ Foreman Service ↔ Execution Backends
```

**Service** (`service/index.ts`) — Standalone daemon. SQLite state, session manager, event detection, learning loop, HTTP API. Runs 24/7. Never makes policy decisions.

**Pi Extension** (`pi-package/`) — Thin client. 7 tools + dashboard widget + /foreman command. The conversation IS the policy.

**Skill** (`pi-package/skills/foreman/SKILL.md`) — Behavioral instructions for the LLM. Taste, first-principles thinking, skill selection.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install with the onboarding wizard
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drewstone/foreman/main/install.sh | bash

# Re-run setup later
foreman setup
```

The installer is consent-first. It explains each capability, asks before enabling it, writes config to `~/.foreman/.env`, and can install only the parts you want: core service, budgets, provider keys, Telegram, and Pi wiring.

## What It Does

- **Dispatches work** to Claude Code sessions with rich, context-loaded prompts (6,000+ chars of project state, past decisions, learned flows, dead ends, operator exemplars)
- **Learns from you** — scans your Claude/Pi/Codex sessions, extracts workflows, taste, anti-patterns via LLM analysis
- **Works in isolation** — every dispatch uses a git worktree, opens PRs against your branch
- **Tracks everything** — SQLite decisions log, goal progress, cost, taste signals
- **Never stops** — always has work in flight, monitors sessions, dispatches more when idle
